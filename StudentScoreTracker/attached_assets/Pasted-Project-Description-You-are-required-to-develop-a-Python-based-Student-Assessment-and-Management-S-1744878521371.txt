Project Description:
You are required to develop a Python-based Student Assessment and Management System
that provides an integrated platform for recording attendance, quizzes, and exams. The system
should also allow the addition of student accounts, record their performance using student
numbers, and generate reports.
Project Requirements:
Your system should include the following features:
1. User Management
● Admin Login: Secure authentication for system administrators.
● Student Accounts: Ability to add new student accounts with student numbers, names,
and other relevant details.
● Role-Based Access: Admins can manage data, while students can only view their
records.
2. Attendance Recording
● Record student attendance based on their student number and date.
● Display attendance reports for individual students or the entire class.
● Export attendance records as a report (CSV or PDF).
3. Assessment Platform
● Quiz and Exam Module: Allow students to take quizzes and exams.
● Question Bank: Admins should be able to create and store multiple-choice and
short-answer questions.
● Automated Grading: Multiple-choice questions should be auto-graded, while
short-answer questions require manual grading.
4. Performance Recording and Reports
● Record quiz and exam scores by selecting the student’s number.
● Generate student performance reports.
● Export reports in CSV or PDF format.
5. Data Storage
● Use a database (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) to store student records, attendance,
and assessment results.
Technical Requirements:
● Programming Language: Python (with Flask or Django for a web-based approach)
● Database: SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL
● UI (Optional): Tkinter (for GUI-based) or Flask/Django (for web-based)
● Report Generation: Pandas and ReportLab for data processing and PDF generation
Submission Guidelines:
● Submit the complete source code with proper documentation.
● Include a README file explaining how to set up and use the system.
● Ensure the system is functional and tested before submission.
● Provide a short demo video showcasing the system's features (optional but
recommended).
